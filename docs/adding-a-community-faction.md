# Adding a community faction

The generic process for adding a faction from `community-races/factions/<name>/` to the bot,
with every correction made so far folded in. Keep this file free of faction-specific data —
a faction's numbers live in `data/factions.json`, its home in `data/sectors.json`, its rules in
the commit that added it, and its behaviour in its tests. The sections below are what to do and
what has gone wrong before, not what any one faction is.

## Integration checklist

- **Source inventory.** List the faction folder first. The usual set is `<key>_{info,board,home,ambassador,icon}`, in mixed `.jpg`/`.png`, and folders do ship files missing. Note what exists; if something the implementation needs is missing (a home tile, a portrait), say so and ask — never improvise an asset.
- **Rules text.** The card and the board are the only rules source. Transcribe the card verbatim (setup resources, colony ships, technologies, sector contents, activations, trade value, reputation track, every ability with its exact wording) and flag anything illegible instead of guessing. Read the card yourself as well as delegating the transcription: crop the card at native resolution and zoom on the numbers that matter. Do this for every image that carries rules text.
- **Decode the board against an implemented faction's board.** Faction boards are made from a shared template: put the new board next to an implemented one of the same size and the *differences are the rule deltas*. This is how the reputation-slot frames (ambassador frame present or absent) and the action bubbles above the action circles (how many colony ships an Influence action flips) are read; neither is written anywhere else.
- **Faction data** in `data/factions.json`: starting resources and colony ships, home sector, action limits, trade value, influence discs and tracks, technologies, reputation track, ship costs, stock, blueprints, population cube counts. Match the existing field set and key order. Put shared facts and reusable capabilities in the file (see *Faction facts in the data* below) and read them through `helpers/FactionData.py`. Keep unique behavior in its existing handler when that is simpler.
- **Home sector** in `data/sectors.json` plus `images/resources/hexes/<id>.png`. Pick the number the artwork prints if it is free, otherwise a free one; a printed "SECTOR nnn" can be template art. Give the tile its VP value, artifact flag, population squares with their snap coordinates, wormholes and the ship structure snaps. The tile image recipe used so far: crop the source square image to the hexagon (dropping the black margins) and resize to 1024x890 RGBA. Derive each `*_snap` from the printed square and verify by rendering the tile.
- **Population cube counts are not printed.** Every existing faction's track starts at 12 cubes per resource, minus one cube for every cube the setup places on the home sector's squares, including an Advanced square that a starting technology unlocks. Verify against the other factions' data before copying a number.
- **Selection.** Set `"community": true` and a `"setup_color"` in the faction's data (it then appears only with `community_factions` enabled, respects drafted-away factions and explicit bans, and neither causes nor receives colour blocks), and add it to the faction choices in `commands/setup_commands.py`. Post its board plus its rules as text in the faction reference thread; do not post a separate reference/card image.
- **Colours.** New colours are not supported; prefer one of the existing setup colours (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, white, pink, brown, teal). A community faction may share a colour with a standard faction — the draft allows both — and setup hands the second one another free colour. Standard factions share colours with their Terran equivalents on purpose.
- **Name lookups.** Give the faction an `"artwork"` key in its data; `helpers/FactionData.py` derives images, emoji and blueprint keys from it (data key and artwork key may differ, e.g. `exl`/`exile`). Do not add a name table anywhere.
- **Artwork.** Under `images/resources/components/`: `factions/<art>_{board,info,ambassador}.png`, `layouts/factionImages/<art>_image.png` (the icon), `layouts/faction_titles/name_trade_<art>.png`, `layouts/blueprints/classes/<art>_{interceptor,cruiser,dreadnought,starbase}_class.png`. The class images are 300x115 (dreadnought 315x148), transparent, white silhouette + two-line class name + initiative chevrons, and are pasted over the blueprint art — they usually have to be composed from the board and then verified by rendering them at the paste offset. Set `"portrait_image": true` in the faction data so `DrawHelper.faction_portrait` uses the dedicated `factionImages/<art>_image.png` instead of the crop used for standard boards.
- **Abilities: reuse before building.** For every ability, grep for the closest existing flow *before* writing anything and route the ability through it; only add shared logic when the grep comes up empty. Name the flow each ability reuses in the commit message. Prefer a declared ability and a shared implementation when the behavior fits an existing pattern; a unique faction behavior can keep a direct name check in its existing handler. Write down the shared state machines the abilities can reach (see below) and check each one by hand.
- **A setup action before the game starts.** A card action the bot models happens in the pre-game phase, before the first turn: declare its capability in faction data and add its setup action to `PreGameButtons.tasksForPlayer` in `Buttons/PreGame.py` and route it to the flow that already does that thing. Advance the task only after a successful action; return the next task name when a follow-up choice is needed. The game waits for it, so the prompt has to be completable on its own — and the flow must not offer a turn-only button, because there is no turn to go back to yet.
- **Tests.** Data (fields, tech, parts), home sector (data, tile art, a render), draft visibility/colour/bans, artwork existence and size, each ability, and a real first round through setup. Add the faction as another player to the existing multi-faction first-round test rather than writing a new round test; it also catches setup hooks clashing. The first round loads some art only inside fire-and-forget render tasks, where a failure is swallowed — the artwork existence/size test is what actually covers those files. Any test that counts factions (draft buttons) needs updating in the same change.
- **Verify.** Run the *full* suite, not the faction's tests. Grep the callers of every shared file touched and confirm existing factions are unchanged, including the shared population-removal paths and the draft. Re-read the ability text next to the code. Confirm every referenced artwork path exists and matches its source. Report anything uncertain from the transcription for a human to check against the physical card.
- **Look at the render.** Run the first-round test with `--basetemp=<dir>`, then `local_debug/render_show_game.py <game_id> <dir>` on the saved game, and check the home tile, the player area and the blueprints by eye. Tests stub the art, so only this shows the picture.
- **Branch hygiene.** Base the work on the latest base branch, commit as you go, and before the final report fetch/merge the base branch again and re-check the faction's wiring against anything that moved (draft rules, setup sends and shared helpers have all moved under a faction once).

## Faction facts in the data

Shared faction facts and reusable capabilities belong in `data/factions.json`
and are read through `helpers/FactionData.py`. Reuse existing fields and flows
when they fit; do not invent a data shape or hook for hypothetical factions.
The fields in use:

| Field | Read by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `artwork` | `FactionData.artwork_name` | image/emoji/blueprint key (differs from the data key: `exl`/`exile`) |
| `name_aliases` | `FactionData.BY_NAME` | optional old names that resolve to the same faction facts and artwork |
| `setup_color` | `DraftButtons.getColor` | colour the draft hands the faction |
| `community` | `DraftButtons.getDraftButtons` | draft only with `community_factions` on |
| `starting_ships` | `GamestateHelper.setup_finished` | ships on the home sector at setup (default `["int"]`) |
| `influence_colony_ships` | `Buttons/Influence.py`, the player area drawing | colony ships one Influence action flips (default 2) |
| `reputation_only_slots` | `PlayerHelper.is_reputation_only_slot` | indices of the reputation track with no ambassador slot |
| `blueprint_slots` | `DrawHelper.draw_blueprint_slots` | per ship (`interceptor`/`cruiser`/`dread`/`starbase`), one `[column, half-row]` cell per parts entry when the printed slot shape is not the standard one |
| `portrait_image` | `DrawHelper.faction_portrait` | use `factionImages/<art>_image.png` instead of the standard board crop |
| `abilities` | `FactionData.has(player, "...")` | named abilities the implementation is guarded by |
| `vp_per_*` | `DrawHelper.get_public_points` | end-of-game points per owned tile, artifact tile, shrine, orbital population or Ancient ship |
| `discovery_part_vp`, `discovery_part_ship_cost`, `money_trade_ratio`, `reputation_draw_money` | scoring, `PlayerHelper.get_ship_cost`, trade and reputation flows | the named number where an ability is a count |

An ability whose behavior is a flow (Techno-Magic, Power of the Ancients,
two discovery choices) keeps its implementation where the flow lives — the
code only asks whether the player has it. Grep for `FactionData.has` before
inventing an id: an ability that already exists has a guard at its
implementation. Move repeated name checks into data when that simplifies the
existing code. If a quirk is unique and has no useful shared data shape, keep
it in its existing handler and explain the choice in the commit message.
Numbers a faction accumulates during play live on the player instead (Magellan's `magPartPoints`,
Lyra's `shrine_type`), as fields setup copies in for that faction only.

## Shortcomings to expect (each one happened)

- **A printed quantity with no verb.** A note or bubble printed next to an action can be a *replacement* for the standard value, not an addition (`+1 BUI` next to `2 BUI` was an addition on one card, a bare `1` next to the standard `2` was a reduction on another). Compare the same spot on an official or implemented board before choosing.
- **Slot types are art, not text.** Whether a sector's or reputation slot is reputation-only, ambassador-only or mixed is only visible in the board's frame art, and the three renderings differ: a plain gold shield is reputation-only, a notched frame with a hex-grid fill is ambassador-only, and a gold shield inside the notched frame is mixed. Compare the same slot position against an implemented board whose data is known, not against a description of the card.
- **The card and the board can disagree in tone, not in content.** Where a card note is ambiguous, the board's iconography is the tiebreak; where both are silent (ability timing, "any type" choices), write the reading down and flag it in the report.
- **Derived artwork is not shipped.** Expect to compose the title and class images from the board; keep them at the sizes the existing ones use and verify visually, not just by file size.
- **The home tile may not be a hexagon on black.** Some factions ship a full-bleed scene instead. Reconstruct the hexagon from the straight clips printed across the art — they are the tile edges — keep the canvas inscribed so the left and right tips survive, and verify by rendering. Do not assume the printed ring marks are population squares: a tile can print them as artifact-key markers while its real squares sit elsewhere. The card's Starting System icons list the square types. Setup fills every non-advanced home square with a cube, as on the base homes, whether or not the art prints one, plus any Advanced square a starting technology unlocks; the population tracks drop by the same count.
- **No emoji token.** A new faction has no `<key>token` emoji, so its token falls back to ❓ until one is uploaded. Cosmetic; note it.
- **Both transcriptions can be wrong.** The lead's reading and the delegated cross-check have each misread the same printed track, in opposite directions. Settle a disputed number with a sharpened high-zoom crop, and where a glyph stays ambiguous, template-match it against the same circle on a board whose value is known. Never write data from a reading the other reader disputed without re-verifying at high zoom.
- **New answer-style prompts.** A prompt that resolves once must be added to `ANSWER_BUTTONS` in `listeners/ButtonListener.py`, and its handler must refuse a second resolution on its own as well.
- **Extra population locations.** An ability that puts a cube on the influence disc (or any non-planet location) needs: a tile field for the cube, drawing at the disc rather than a planet snap, the normal population-track bookkeeping, and the neutral-style return path so losing the sector, combat hits, elimination, the upkeep graveYard and the population-gone check all handle it. List it in `PopulationButtons.findFullPopulation` and check `GamestateHelper.remove_pop` and `PlayerHelper.upkeep`.
- **Faction counts in tests.** Adding a faction breaks assertions that count draft buttons or faction lists; fix them in the same change.
- **Check the shape of lookup tables a new branch adds.** A per-type value that should be a list of ids but is a string is iterated character by character, and an `any()`/`all()` over it silently passes. One instrumented run through the real flow catches it.
- **Press the colour the setup actually assigned.** generalSetup hands out colours by getColor order with a pop(0) fallback, so a faction's colour depends on which factions are in the game; a first-round test copied from another faction presses the wrong FCID colour and the press silently no-ops.
- **Per-combat abilities.** "At the start of each combat" means `Combat.startCombat`, which reruns for every new pairing on a multi-player tile — not `startCombatThreads`, which only runs once per tile. Anything temporary the ability installs must come off at the next `startCombat` as well as in `declareAWinner`.
- **Changing a shared button id breaks live games.** Buttons already posted keep their old `custom_id`; a parser that now expects an extra field must still accept the old shape.
- **Reusing a turn flow for a setup hook.** Turn actions carry turn-only parts (the "using their turn" message, trading for the cost, Finish/Restart). Gate them with a flag rather than copying the flow.
- **A new mode of a shared flow needs that flow's Undo.** Without it a misclick cannot be taken back, and a once-only guard then refuses the retry.
- **Rules the board prints must reach the player area.** `DrawHelper.player_area` draws some board numbers from data (action activations, the colony ships one Influence action flips) and some from hardcoded faction lists. An ability that changes the latter needs the drawing updated too — and a number that lives in two places (rule and drawing) belongs in `factions.json`.
- **Do not narrow an ability beyond its text.** A reading that excludes a case the wording covers (a grey square from "any Advanced planet") was once written as a fix; check every exclusion against the exact text, and flag it rather than decide it.
- **The tile number box.** Sectors without `images/resources/hexes/numberless/<id>.png` get `masks/banner.png` pasted over the printed nameplate with the map position on top. Home art with no nameplate there shows the box as a cutout; a numberless version (nameplate removed) avoids it.
- **First-faction over-engineering.** The first faction built a parallel flow for an ability that an existing path already covered, and had to be simplified later. Hence the reuse-first rule above; and never scope the abilities out of the notes — the ability text is the part most likely to be got wrong silently.
- **Class images are shown much smaller than they are committed.** `ImageCacheHelper` resizes them to about 90×33 in the player area; a name that is legible at 300×115 can disappear at display size. Check the composed image at the paste size, and give light blueprint headers a dark outline.
- **Held sectors need two counts.** A reserve that is held off the board must be excluded from the outer-rim cleanup *and* included in the explore-position enumeration, or the last held tile becomes unplaceable when its deck empties.
- **Copy a pairing before extending it.** `pairing = attacker; pairing += defender` mutates the tile's combat sides. Use `list(attacker) + list(defender)` wherever the result is only a local list.
- **A home nameplate can sit over a population square.** A full-bleed home tile may need a numberless variant plus a per-tile number position; otherwise the standard banner covers a square or leaves a second printed number visible.
- **`starting_ships` does not decrement `ship_stock`.** Set the stock to the physical count minus the ships setup places; do not copy the default array when a faction starts with a non-Interceptor.
- **Check the body of a shared flag, not its name.** A flag such as a retreat penalty may still add draws for destroyed ships; a faction whose wording removes every draw needs its own guard in the shared reputation function.
- **Blueprint cell counts come from the board render.** Plans and printed layouts can disagree with the actual number of part rectangles; count them from the art before writing the parts array. When the printed slot shape differs from the standard blueprint, give the faction `blueprint_slots` (one `[column, half-row]` cell per parts entry, see `DrawHelper.draw_blueprint_slots`) instead of adding name branches or coordinate overrides.
- **Reconcile faction counts once per merge wave.** Each branch updates draft-count assertions to its own total; after merging several factions, set the shared count once and verify that every faction still appears with the right colour.
- **Initiative changes need every speed path.** An ability that adds or changes initiative must be applied consistently in the speed enumeration, the manual-button validity check, the reroll path and the end-of-combat checks; fixing only the prompt leaves stale buttons live.
- **A deferred hit still has to close the pairing.** A target button whose resolution is deferred must still call the end-of-combat check when it removes the last ship of a side; otherwise the combat waits forever after the button is pressed.
- **A free activation's filter belongs in the next button id.** If a free move is restricted to one ship class, put that filter into the emitted `moveFrom` id and test the id the UI actually emits, not a hand-written equivalent.
- **A displayed action count must be enforced.** `influence_apt`, `build_apt` and the other activation numbers are not just labels; the flow must cap the number of placements/removals/units, including the second and third presses.
- **A built-in part slot must be excluded from upgrades.** If a faction's blueprint prints a fixed module in a slot, omit that slot from the part menu and reject a forged/stale selection; otherwise the player gets the module's benefit plus a free replacement part.
- **Income from a placed piece must be counted before bankruptcy.** A Harvester-like income source that arrives at upkeep has to be applied before the bankruptcy check, or a player is wrongly forced to trade/remove control.
- **A custom blueprint panel is not the shared template.** Only `blueprint_<ship>` files are resized to the paste area; a faction-specific panel either keeps its native size or uses the shared frame. Check the composed player area, not just the file dimensions.
- **A no-combat bombing prompt still needs the weapon/power choice.** If the card lets a faction use a bombing technology outside a normal combat, offer that choice in the bombing prompt instead of claiming the combat-start declaration rules it out.
- **A held home tile may need a per-tile number position.** Removing the printed sector number is not enough if the nameplate remains; a `number_snap` or an inpainted nameplate keeps “PLANET SECTOR 314” from appearing on the map.

## Shared state machines an ability can reach

Check each one the faction touches, by hand and with a test: population placement and removal
(`findEmptyPopulation` / `findFullPopulation` / `remove_pop` / `upkeep` graveYard / elimination /
population-gone), prompt resolution (`ANSWER_BUTTONS`), scoring (`DrawHelper.get_public_points`),
the draft and colour allocation, setup hooks in `Buttons/PreGame.py` (several factions can be
drafted in one game), the influence action's colony-ship refresh, and ship cost/upgrade paths.
